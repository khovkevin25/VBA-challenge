The goal of this challenge was to create a VBA script that looped through each sheet of the "Multiple_year_stock_data" workbook in order to determine a summary of various information. This included the Ticker symbol, the Quarterly Change, the Percent Change, and the Total Stock Volume, as well as finding the greatest percent increase and decrease, and the greatest total volume. These values were determined for each quarter, with the data separated out on each tab.

The script used to perform these tasks is located under the file "vba_challenge_script". This file is the script used to loop through all of the sheets. The script used to only run through one sheet is under the file "vba_challenge_script_nonrecursive". The majority of the code used was modeled off of activities done during class. I used Stack Overflow to add in a code line in order to autofit all columns at the end of the script to make the overall view of the workbook better once completed.

"ws.Cells.EntireColumn.AutoFit"

The following outputs were determined after running the macro. These screenshots of these results can be found in the folder "vba_challenge_results".
